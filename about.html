   <h1 class="abouth1">What does yoga mean to me?</h1>
   <p class="aboutparagraph"> How do you take care of your soul and mind? How do you draw awareness deeper and deeper into yourself, away from the noise of the external world and the chaos we live in? Social distance made us realize the importance of connection. Especially connecting with our own body and mind. I know it's not easy to stay calm, be nice, and keep positive with all this fear surrounding us... but the very least we can do is to try. You are trying to stay in a safe, warm, and loving place where you feel supported. The world can still be a good place if you're at peace with yourself. That's how I got into yoga. I have just moved to the USA. Being from a small town in Brazil, I have never heard about yoga. My first introduction to the practice was in 2016 when I went to a yoga studio seeking peace of mind since I was going through a tough time in life. I didn't know what I was doing. At the end of my first class, the instructor took me aside and welcomed me to the studio. Introduced to a couple of books and made me feel welcome to come again. I went home, and after a quick youtube search, I was hooked on a <strong>"30 day Yoga Challenge"</strong> video. That was it. I fell in love with the practice. I'm still very new to yoga, but I can certainly mention the benefits of this practice for me. Yoga has taught me how to cultivate my health, physical, emotional, mental, and social well-being. Yes, it's not only seating there, and everything happens... Yoga is a lot of regular practice, with many different postures and movements (sometimes it gets hard, sweat, but all the time, it feels good). I know it's hard to stop for 1-2h of your day and don't think about anything, to let your thoughts go and simply practice yoga. But trust me, you should give it a try. People always ask me, "why do you practice yoga?" I practice yoga because it makes me feel good, not only outside but especially inside. And when I go to a yoga studio, it is where I feel even better because there's no judgment... No prejudice... Yoga is for everyone. For every body. Yoga is more than a workout; it's about working on yourself. I had a hard time fitting in because most people think of yoga as something hard to do. I wasn't different. Ah, all those poses. I can never do that! Wrong perspectives. It was tough for me to understand that putting a lot of pressure on myself for quick results would make me quickly give up. Today I can feel and see the results. I'm not afraid to move slowly, to grow slowly. I listen to my body. Yoga is about doing what feels good to your body‚Äîkeep moving and feel good. It's not about headstands and backbands. Of course, these are yoga poses that are part of a practice, but if you cant do them does not mean that you cant practice yoga.
